This repository contains a web application built with React and TypeScript, featuring user authentication functionality.

## Features

- Built with [React](https://react.dev/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- User authentication (login, logout, protected routes)
- Modern UI and responsive design
- Easy to customize and extend

## Installation

cd your-repo-name
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

```

The app will run locally at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Authentication

Authentication is implemented using [context API](https://react.dev/reference/react/useContext) and hooks. The codebase contains examples for:

- Protecting routes
- Storing and retrieving tokens
- Handling login and logout flows

You can easily adapt the authentication logic to use your preferred backend or third-party provider (e.g., Firebase, Auth0).
